### Notes

The direction of the document is more to explain the work in turms of effort. This is similar to the value based 
evanomic theories that already exist. 

# Main Hypothosis

That the economy should be symulated and understood in terms of effort as the lowest usfull unit of interst.

When given the chance people will make volontary exchanges in order to reduce their total effort output. This 
exchange will be made if the option is of lower net effort than the next best option. 
People tend to arange all economic activity in turms of effort. 


# Documnet Structure

The structure should be something like
* Hypothisis in the form of fundamental theoretical assertions 
* Individual total change of effort
* Methods of analysis

The goal is to build a solid definition of the low level ideas in such a way that they can be used to build higher level ideas and dynamics, 
all the way to evaluating ideas such as value. 

Finaly the distinction should be made between understanding how all people operate and attempting to point out ways that people should operate. 
The carfull consideration of the subjective nature of people should be included without loosing all sight of usfullnss by lacking unifiormity. 
By making a system that chases too much accuracy in prediction the uniformity is reduced all the way down to the individual level, the utility 
of having an economic model is nearly nothing.
